# Edge-To-Shoe-App
The Pix2Pix GAN project presented here implements an advanced image-to-image translation system specifically tailored for converting shoe edge sketches into photorealistic shoe images. This implementation leverages a carefully constructed adversarial network architecture where the generator transforms edge outlines into detailed shoe renderings, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between generated and authentic shoes.
This API implements the Generator model and makes a user friendly UI for generating authentic shoes from sketches.
